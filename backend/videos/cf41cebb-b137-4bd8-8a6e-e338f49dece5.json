  "prompt": "POV shot, a graceful deer sprints across the golden savanna, its white tail a frantic beacon of fear. The ground vibrates. Suddenly, a majestic African lion with a thick, golden mane, eyes burning with predatory focus, bursts into the frame, muscles rippling under its tawny fur. The lion is inches behind, it lunges, claws extended, narrowly missing the deer. The deer dodges, a heartbeat from capture. The lion surges again, jaws open, leaping high, aiming a bite at the deer's neck, teeth snapping shut inches away as the deer desperately twists. Dust explodes from the dry earth. The air vibrates with pounding hooves, guttural roars echoing closely, and frantic bleats. Upbeat, driving African-inspired percussion underscores the escalating drama. Ochre, sienna, and gold dominate the color palette, with the deer in stark brown and white. Shallow depth of field isolates the intensity of the hunt. The late afternoon sun casts long, dramatic shadows, silhouetting the chase. Wind whispers fiercely through the tall grass.",
