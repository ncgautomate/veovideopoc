  "prompt": "A majestic African lion with a thick, golden mane, its eyes burning with predatory focus, sprints across the golden savanna. Muscles ripple under its tawny fur. A graceful deer, white tail a frantic beacon, flees. Low-angle, steadycam tracking shot, wildlife documentary style. The lion lunges, claws extended, narrowly missing the deer; the deer dodges, a heartbeat from capture. Again, the lion surges, jaws open, a near-miss bite. Dust explodes from the dry earth. The air vibrates with pounding hooves, guttural roars, and frantic bleats. Upbeat, driving African-inspired percussion underscores the drama. Ochre, sienna, gold dominate; deer in stark brown and white. Shallow depth of field isolates the hunt's intensity. The late afternoon sun casts long, dramatic shadows. Wind whispers through the tall grass.",
